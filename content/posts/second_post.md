Thanks to the quest book being janky, and not counting stuff you have done previously, I had to go exploring to kill some cows to progress towards the pizza gloves.

While I was out exploring, I had the ovens cooking some coke oven bricks. When I got back they were done and I was able to make the first multiblock!

This inital base is going to be VERY jank, as there is not really any flat areas and I do not feel like making any. I don't plan on being here for too much longer as I dont want to have to spend too long moving. I just need to find somewhere else to live that has reasonable humidity.

Putting the coke oven on to make some charcoal left me with a bit of time, so I decided to go out exploring to find some stuff. Nothing in particular in mind that I wanted to find, but lots of stuff needed still for progressing. Quite happy with what I got, and need to still look at the map to see if there is somewhere nice to setup a base.
