After messing around with shader settings and stuff to get the settings just right for my liking, I created the world.

Note: This run I won't be taking quest rewards (outside of the personal dimension, as that cannot be made any other way). Also I am trying to not hyperfocus / nolife, as I want to keep playing this for a long time, and I can easily burn out in a month or so.

**World Name:** GTNH-MaybeThisTime<br>
**Seed:** notdeeznuts

I found a lake about 100 blocks away from the spawn. Making a small hole in the side of the terrain for the first few nights.

I went searching a bit in the surrounding area for some foods or maybe a better place to live. The supply of food is quite limited but I have started planting already, and killing off animals for meat too.

After gathering the gravel and sand required for the questbook from nearby, I made a bed which is super useful for survival. It felt like this was a much harder task previously in GTNH, but I think I was just nieve.

I decided to try and find a river for the clay as it spawns on the sides and will not leave funky water holes (thanks GTNH for non-infinite water). Gathering foods and other random things I found along the way, eventually deciding to call it quits on finding a river and just getting the required clay from random water lakes. I also got some hardened clay from a mountain as it is far easier to grind into dust than clay balls.

On my way home, I found a structure that will be quite useful for avoiding some future Thaumcraft... but more on that later.

After this, I did a little bit more quest book progression, some farming of logs, and decided to call it quits on the first day. Not as much progress as I would have hoped, but it is a long journey ahead.
